Hint
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

 

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

# s = "abcabcbb"

# Output: 3


# s = "bbbbb"
# Output: 1

s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3 #wke
